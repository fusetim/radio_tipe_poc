# esp-rs-devcontainer

This repository uses a container to offer the environment needed to develop applications for [ESP
boards using Rust](https://github.com/esp-rs), it also provides integration with Visual Studio Code using [remote containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

For instructions on how to integrate devcontainers to existing repositories, see
[this section](#integrating-devcontainer-in-existing-repositories).

Developing projects for ESP boards in an online environment is also available with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/):
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/github.com/SergioGasquez/esp-rs-devcontainer/)

This repository is can be used as template repository.

# Quick Start

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - [Remote - Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
> ### Using Podman instead of Docker
> Using Podman as container tool is possible when using a Linux host machine.
> When using Podman, flashing devices from the container is possible.
>
> > There has been some testing using Lima and Podman in other platforms but with
> > no success so far. Feel free to test with them and report any feedback.
> #### Requirements
>   - [Install Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
>   -  Uncomment the `runArgs` line from `devcontianer.json`:
>
>       ```
>       "runArgs": ["--userns=keep-id", "--device", "/dev/ttyUSB0", "--security-opt", "label=disable", "--annotation", "run.oci.keep_original_groups=1"],
>       ```
>      - Edit the device argument to match the serial port of your board.
>   - Edit Visual Code Settings:
>     -  Via UI: In _Extension>Remote-Containers_ set `Remoteâ€ºContainers:Docker Path`
>   to `podman`
>     -  Via JSON: Add the following line:
>         ```
>         "remote.containers.dockerPath": "podman",
>         ```

## Setup

Select the tag of the [sergiogasquez/esp-rs-env](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sergiogasquez/esp-rs-env)
image you would like to use by modifying the `image` property in
`devcontainer.json`.
For more information regarding the image tags, refer to [esp-rs-container](https://github.com/SergioGasquez/esp-rs-container).


## Running the container

1. Open the folder with Visual Studio Code and open the container, there are
   several ways to open the container:
   1. When opening Visual Studio Code, a popup will come up asking to open reopen the folder in a Container, click `Yes`
   1. Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`
   2. Use the open in a remote window button on the bottom left corner to
   `Reopen in Container`
2. Wait for the container to build and run, once the container is running, you
   should have a working environment to develop ESP boards using Rust
   - If you want to generate an application using the [esp-idf-template](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template) use:
     - `cargo generate --git https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template cargo`
    > There is also a `no_std` template project: https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-template

    > Be sure to match the installed environment in the selected image tag (espidf version and board)

## Build

Using [cargo-espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash) tool is recommended
since it allows saving the generated image in the disk or flash the resulting binary
to the board.

`cargo build` is also available and it generates the resulting application under
target folder

## Flash
Any method of flashing ESP boards from your host device should also work.

### Cargo espflash

> As mentioned before, if using Podman, [cargo espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/tree/master/cargo-espflash) can be used to flash the ESP board from the container.
### [Adafruit ESPTool](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/)
WebSerial ESPTool is designed to be a web-capable option for programming ESP boards.

Since the local repository folder is synchronised with the container `~/workspace` folder, we recommend using `cargo espflash save-image --merge <appName>.bin ` to generate a binary.

In order to flash it:
1. Open the [Adafruit ESPTool](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/) flashing tool.
2. Choose the desired baudrate.
3. Connect to the serial port of the ESP board.
4. Upload the generated binary.

## Monitor

Any serial monitor used from your host device works, like [espmonitor](https://github.com/esp-rs/espmonitor).

> Using Podman also allows using the argument `--monitor` of cargo-espflash.

### Online Serial Monitor

Using an online serial monitor is also an option [Serial Terminal](https://serial.huhn.me/) working fine in [some browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Serial#browser_compatibility).

# Wokwi Simulator

The devcontainer includes the option of simulating the exercises with [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).

In order to build and run a Wokwi simulation, a script, `run.sh`, under the
`wokwi` folder, is provided to build and run the Wokwi simulation, in order
to use it:
1. Set the `ESP_BOARD` environment variable:
   `$ export ESP_BOARD=<target>`. Possible values of `<target>` are:
   - `esp32`: ESP32 DevKit V1
   - `esp32c3`: ESP32 C3 DevKit M1
   - `esp32c3-rust`: [Rust ESP Board](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board)
2. Set the `CURRENT_PROJECT` environment variable:
   `$ export CURRENT_PROJECT=<project>`.Pointing to your project folder.
3. Run the bash script: `$ bash wokwi/run.sh`

A task is provided via `.vscode/tasks.json` to facilitate executing the script:
1. Execute the task `Build and run Wokwi simulation`
   1. Set the `CURRENT_PROJECT` pointing to the your project.
   2. Select your `ESP_BOARD`.


> When using Gitpod online environment, VScode tasks are not available.

# Integrating devcontainer in existing repositories

In order to add devcontainer features to an existing repository:
1. Copy the `.devcontainer` folder to your repository.
2. Edit the `image` property of `devcontainer.json` with you desired tag.
3. For Gitpod support, copy the `.gitpod.yml` file.
   - For instructions about how to add a "Open in Gitpod" button, see their
      [official documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started#open-in-gitpod-button)
4. If you also want to add Wokwi Simulation support:
   - Copy the `wokwi` folder.
   - Use the run.sh script to run simulations, for detailed information on how
  to properly execute it, see [Wokwi Simulator](#wokwi-simulator) Section.
5. If you want to upload code to your board with Adafruit online tool or use Wokwi
   simulator, you would also require copying the `config-files` folder. Feel free,
   to copy only the file of your target board.
